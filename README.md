# Solar-Lebanon
Personal project on solar energy in Lebanon

Due to the electricity crisis in Lebanon, a lot of people have been looking into solar power as an alternative. This app is a solar panel calculator. Given some information, it tells the user the amount of solar panels they're probably going to need. The app also informs the user about the amount of sunlight different areas in Lebanon get and the forecast for the next week or so.

This project was a chance for me to apply the web dev skills I had been picking up to build something that could possibly have an impact and help people back home.

To run this app:
1) Clone the repo
2) run 'npm i' in the front-end and back-end directories
3) in seperate terminals, run npm start and node app.js in the front-end and back-end directories respectively.
4) use the app!
